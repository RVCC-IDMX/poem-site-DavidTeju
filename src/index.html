				<span class="line">Our fathers must have sinned: we pay for it!</span>

				<span class="line"
					>Through them the base-born tribe that sold their king</span
				>
				<span class="line"> Sneaked into power, and in high places sit,</span>
				<span class="line">And do their will and wish in everything;</span>
				<span class="line">
					For they may rob and kill, grieve and disgrace</span
				>
				<span class="line"> All who are left alive of Eiver's race.</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="line"
					>They seized with daring guile on rank and pelf,</span
				>

				<span class="line"> And swore that they would never bend a knee</span>

				<span class="line">Unto the king: they robbed the Church herself:</span>

				<span class="line">
					They stole our princes' lands, and o'er the sea</span
				>

				<span class="line">They packed those princes, or drove them away</span>

				<span class="line">To barren rocks and fields that have no clay.</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="line">That spawn of base mechanics! who could ne'er,</span>

				<span class="line"> Though Doomsday came, by any art be made</span>

				<span class="line">Noble, are noble now, and have no care:</span>

				<span class="line"> Snugly they sit and safe and unafraid</span>

				<span class="line">In stately places, proud as if the mud</span>

				<span class="line"
					>And slime that swills their veins were princes' blood.</span
				>
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="line">Let us be wise and wary of that gang!</span>

				<span class="line">
					When they seem friendly know they have much wit,</span
				>

				<span class="line">And if it come that any man shall hang,</span>

				<span class="line"> This neck will go unchoked, that nose unslit,</span>

				<span class="line">For, be things wry and crooked and to guess,</span>

				<span class="line">Those twisters are at home in twistiness.</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="line">We know now what their plottings were about,</span>

				<span class="line">
					And how they planned, and what they meant to win;</span
				>

				<span class="line"
					>'Twas God, not us, that took their tangles out,</span
				>

				<span class="line"> For no sleek eel inside an oily skin</span>

				<span class="line"
					>Could slip with more address from harm than they</span
				>

				<span class="line">Can slip from punishment and get away.</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="line">When trouble came it was their plan to get</span>

				<span class="line">
					Our friends into the boat they meant to leave,</span
				>

				<span class="line">And there was some one left to pay their debt,</span>

				<span class="line"> And they were free again to lie and thieve:</span>

				<span class="line"
					>So they could put the feet of the man they'd rob</span
				>

				<span class="line">Into the boots of the one that did the job.</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="line">If burnt child does truly dread the flame,</span>

				<span class="line"> If wounded soldier shrinks again to see</span>

				<span class="line">A steel point sloping to him, let the same</span>

				<span class="line"> Experience teach our chiefs that they may be</span>

				<span class="line">Crafty in meeting craft, and may beware</span>

				<span class="line">Of brewer's bees and buzzers everywhere.</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="line">Unto the Mind which pardons sin I pray,</span>
				<span class="line"> I pray to Him who did permit our woe</span>
				<span class="line">But halted our destruction, that to-day</span>
				<span class="line"> Kindness and love and trust and inward glow</span>
				<span class="line">Of vision light our hearts with light divine,</span>
				<span class="line">So that we know our way until the end of time.</span>
